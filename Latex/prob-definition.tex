\section{Problem Definition}

The goal here is to create a basic dating website. We're using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it. Simply put, we want to make a place where you can enter some info about yourself and then find someone who might be a good match for you among a bunch of students. It's all about making a website that's easy to use and helps people connect with each other.
